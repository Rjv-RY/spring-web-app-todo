# SpringBoot-Web-App

This is a learning project, trying out SpringBoot through application.

The stack is as follows:
-Springboot for annotations
-Springboot security for login/logut and page access protection
-Jasper & BootStrap for HTML and styling
-H2 as a local db for testing
-Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for SQL queries
-MySQL connector for easier connections
-MySQL using a Docker Container (For more in-depth testing)

Will actually refine this ReadMe later, thank you for your time.
